In this course, the projects focused on designing and implementing an advising assistance program for the Computer Science department at ABCU. The main goal was to allow users to load course data, print a list of available computer science courses in alphanumeric order, and view detailed information and prerequisites for individual courses.

To solve the problem, I started by designing pseudocode using three different data structures: vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees. I analyzed the run-time and memory trade-offs of each and ultimately chose the hash table for its average-case constant time complexity when accessing course data. Understanding data structures was essential because each one offers unique advantages depending on the required operations, like sorting, searching, or inserting.

During the project, one of the biggest roadblocks I encountered was related to parsing input data and handling edge cases, like courses missing prerequisites or incorrect user input. I resolved these by carefully validating input, testing different scenarios, and refining error handling in the code.

This project helped expand my approach to software design by reinforcing the value of planning before coding. Starting with clear pseudocode gave me a roadmap that made the development process smoother. It also made it easier to translate logic into working C++ code.

Finally, this experience improved the way I write code. I focused more on maintainability by using meaningful variable names, breaking logic into functions, and including inline comments. I also considered how future developers (or even future me) might need to update or extend the program, so I kept the structure flexible and clean.
